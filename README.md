# 🖥️ Keylogger Detector (Text File Monitoring)

A simple **Keylogger Detector** built with CustomTkinter to monitor changes in `.txt` files inside the current working directory.  
If any suspicious file modifications are detected, the app will display an **ALERT** in the GUI.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Real-time monitoring of `.txt` files in the current folder  
- ✅ Alerts when files are modified (size or timestamp change)  
- ✅ Simple and modern GUI built with `customtkinter`  
- ✅ Start/Stop monitoring anytime  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The app scans all .txt files in the current working directory
2. Keeps track of file size and last modified timestamp
3. If a change is detected, an alert message appears in the app


## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only.
It does not guarantee detection of all keyloggers — it only monitors .txt file modifications.
